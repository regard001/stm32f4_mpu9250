# STM32F4 MPU9250
MPU9250 sensor with STM32 F4 microcontroller

Made with the STM32CubeIDE, tested with a Nucleo-F401RE board.
All sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer) can be read using I2C with the given code. The source is based on Sina Darvishi's project extended with the Magnetometer (AK8963) configuration and data read.
